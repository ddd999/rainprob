# rainprob
Downloads Environment Canada weather data and calculates the historical probabilities of rain on weekdays and weekends.

Usage: Enter the exact station name on the stationinfo line, and run main.py.

The program will then download all existing data for that station, excluding the current day. If the station has an extensive history, this may take a while.

After the download, the probabilities of rainfall on weekdays and weekend days will be calculated. This information is probably not particularly useful for anything.
